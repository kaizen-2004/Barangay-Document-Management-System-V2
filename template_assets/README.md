# Template Assets

Drop your official document templates and related assets here so we can map them into the PDF generator.

Suggested structure:
- pdf/    -> source templates (PDF/DOCX) from the barangay
- seals/  -> official seals, stamps, signatures (PNG/JPG)
- fonts/  -> custom fonts required by the template
- notes/  -> any field maps, layout notes, or instructions

When you provide the templates, include the document type name and any field mapping notes.
